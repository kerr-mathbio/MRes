# MRes

Hi to all who are reading this!

This repository contains all of the Matlab scripts I used during my MRes thesis. I have uploaded all of it to here so I am not wasting trees and having it available for everyone to read and access. 

To use the scripts, you must also download the correct function file used by the script. See code within script to determine which function is required. 

Any questions or advice on the code please email ryankerr8@gmail.com

Happy coding!
